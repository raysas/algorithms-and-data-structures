# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

## Algorithms

*series of problems in class/lab/assignments/book... that require DP in order to solve in polynomial time; some algorithms are directly explained in the comments in java files because i'm too lazy to write them here :/*

### Edit Distance

[Edit Distance](./EditDistance.java): from assignment, this problem has many versions where the conditions are shuffled

**Given two words, the edit distance between them is the minimum number
of modifications that must be performed in order to change one into the other. the
possible modifications are :**
* insert a letter
* remove a letter
* substitute a letter with
another.

*e.g., we want to go from ***hello*** to ***ellen***:*
the minimum amout of operations needed is 3
* dellete h (hello-->ello)
* replace o by e (ello-->elle)
* add n (elle-->ellen)

*this algorithm is especially useful for auto-correction*

### Max Rectangle

[Maximal Rectangle](./MaxRectangle.java): really neat.

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |


here the max rectangle is left 4x3 so the program must return 12

### Max Square

[Maximal Square](./MaxSquare.java): from lab; same even simpler algorithm than the rectangle one. I solved this one before it

Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

### Maximum Product Subarray

[Max Product Subarray](MaximumProductSubarray.java): leetcode

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

*e.g. input:*
| 2 | 3 | -2 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|

output: the product is 6, the subarray would be
| 2 | 3 |
|---|---|

### Maximum Subarray

[Max Subarray](MaximumSubarray.java): similar to [LSCS](./LargestContiguousSubarray.java) but w/o backtracking

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### Longest Increasing Subsequence 

[Longest Increasing Subsequence](./LIS.java): assignment problem that took me a week to think of :p 

**Given a sequence of real numbers, use dynamic programming to find the**
**longest increasing subsequence in which the values form a strictly increasing**
**sequence. The values do not have to be consecutive.**

*e.g. input:*
| 1 |10 | 5 | 2 | 17 | 8 | 9 | 11 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

output:
| 1 | 2 | 8 | 9 | 11 |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm)

[Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray](./LargestContiguousSubarray.java): a better implementation would be using a 1-d array, also assignment :p 

**Given a one-dimensional array of integers, use dynamic programming to
find the contiguous subarray within this array of numbers which has the largest sum.**

*e.g., input:*
| -2 | 1 | -3 | 4 | -1 | 2 | 1 | -5 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

output: (sum=6)
| 4 | -1 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|

### Russian Doll Envelopes

[Russian Doll Envelopes](RussianDoll.java): leetcode, this solution might be slow (merge sort + memoization in matrix) but it certainly is not exponential

Given a 2D array of integers envelopes where envelopes[i] = [wi, hi] represents the width and the height of an envelope.

One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the other envelope's width and height.

Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

**Note: You cannot rotate an envelope.**
