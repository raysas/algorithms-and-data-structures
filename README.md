First we started by The Stable Marriage Problem (still to be finished :p), the Connectivity Problem, a revision on the Big-O notation then moved to sorting. Loooooootttsss of sorting, tracing and analysis of worst, average and best running time cases. 
Then, we started hashing, dynamic programming which took a great amount of time. Graphs for sure, starting by a revision on some definitions and moving to traversals algorithms, greedy algorithms to traverse a Minimum Spanning Tree and shortest paths algorithms with detailed tracing and explanation of the running time. 
Concluded this maginificent course with an introduction to P-NP, where we've seen a series of the mostly tackled problems to prove NP completeness by polynomial reductions.
