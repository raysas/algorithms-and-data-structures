## Sorting 

One of the most useful algorithms. There is no always linear running time algorithm, however we can achieve something close to it on several occasions. 
For that, there are numerous sorting algorithm and choosing one can be more efficient than the other depending on the context of the problem. 
Here's a list of the implemented ones in this course whether in class, lab, assignments or mentioned in the reference book (CLRS):

- [Selection sort](selection-sort)
- [Insertion sort](insertion-sort)
- [Shell sort](shell-sort)
- [Bubble sort](bubble-sort)
- [Merge sort](merge-sort)
- [Heap sort](heap-sort)
- [Quick sort](quick-sort)
- [Counting sort](counting-sort)
- [Radix sort](radix-sort)
- [Bucket sort](bucket-sort)
